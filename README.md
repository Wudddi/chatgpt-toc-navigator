# ChatGPT TOC Navigator (Chrome/Edge Extension)

A lightweight browser extension that adds a draggable, clickable Table of Contents (TOC) to ChatGPT conversations so you can jump to earlier messages instantly — especially helpful when answers are long.

> Works by injecting a small UI panel into ChatGPT webpages (content script).  
> This is **not** an OpenAI “plugin/Action” — it’s a **browser extension** that enhances the page UI.

## Features

- ✅ **Clickable TOC**: One item per user prompt (and corresponding assistant reply)
- ✅ **Jump to message**: Click an item to scroll to that turn smoothly
- ✅ **Supports non-text prompts**:
  - 📷 Image-only messages (shows count + optional thumbnails)
  - 📎 File-only messages (shows file name or file count)
- ✅ **Search**: Filter TOC items by keyword
- ✅ **Draggable UI**:
  - Drag the panel by the title area
  - Minimized “TOC” bubble is also draggable
- ✅ **Minimize / Restore**:
  - `Min` → collapses into a small **TOC** bubble
  - Click the bubble → restore the panel
- ✅ **Shared position**:
  - Panel & bubble share the same saved position
- ✅ **Smooth animations**: Fade + scale transitions (not abrupt)
- ✅ **Auto-updates**: TOC updates when new messages appear (MutationObserver)

## How to Use

- **Min**: Click `Min` → panel collapses into a small **TOC** bubble.
- **Restore**: Click the **TOC** bubble → panel reopens at the same position.
- **Hide/Show list**: Click `Hide` (this only collapses the list/search inside the panel).
- **Search**: Type into the search box to filter items.
- **Jump**: Click a TOC item → smooth scroll to that conversation turn.

## Notes / Limitations

- ChatGPT’s DOM structure can change. If OpenAI updates the UI, selectors may need updates.
- Some file cards may not expose filenames consistently; the extension uses best-effort detection.

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1) “Min” works but clicking the TOC bubble doesn’t restore
- Make sure you are using the latest `content.js`.
- If you just dragged the bubble, the immediate click is intentionally ignored to avoid accidental restore.

### 2) The bubble/panel is off-screen
- Resize the browser window or set zoom back to 100%.
- Refresh the page; the extension clamps position back into view.

### 3) TOC items are missing / not updating
- Click `Refresh`.
- If the page was open a long time, DOM changes might need a refresh.

---

## Roadmap (Ideas)

- Nested TOC: parse assistant headings (# / ## / ###) as second-level items
- Bookmark/star important turns
- Export TOC to markdown
- Keyboard shortcut to toggle TOC (e.g., Alt+T)
